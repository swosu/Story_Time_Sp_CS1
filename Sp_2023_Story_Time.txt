Status Quo

It was a nice spring day. We were well rested and we had a tummy full of food.


Initiating Event

We decide to go play golf.
And then the world falls apart. 
We try to fish the ponds.
They took it pretty personal.
And so we decided we wanted to go in the middle of the night.
We wanted to fish for bass.
So we needed a source of light.
We decided to light the world on fire.
